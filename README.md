# Excel_Net_Revenue_Management

The world of Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) is a dynamic world that plays a significant role in our daily lives.  Have you ever wondered how well-known brands like Coca-Cola, Nivea, and Lay's are being managed? This case study will help in getting a better understanding of this industry.

We will start by analyzing a big dataset and by performing your own market analysis. Will go from calculating market share to creating clear visuals to reveal actionable insights. Next,  will use the principles of Net Revenue Management (NRM), which will help to identify new growth opportunities for the company.

We will have to use a variety of Excel tools and functions to calculate the true potential of these growth buckets. We will not only master everything which relates to PivotTables, VLOOKUP, and forecasting but also have a better understanding of what is happening behind the scenes of FMCG brands.
